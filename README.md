This is eLOS. What is it?

eLOS, is a toolkit. It is a toolchain. It is a workbench; a development environment. A place for home management.
It is the missing tool for your computer. It is the front page of your life, and among the many ways it works, it works only at home, only on the web, or somewhere in between.
Always, only, owned and operated, by your hands.

- Who am I?

I fit within, but don't identify with many stereotypes which are applied to me. I suspect this is common.
I was raised by engineers, in the suburbs, middle class, middle child, young problem solver and technophile.
I grew up preferring my computer to socializing. My friends were few and far between, but not bad ones or disruptive. Merely misfortunately elsewhere suddenly.
I learned computers from my dad. Both of my parents loved to read, and my mom showed me the glory of writing.
One day I hope to write a novel, but until this I hope this will suffice.

Idea day: Blog posts about my ideas.

If I cannot find, concoct, or generate an idea worthy of a blog post by this day, then I most do a livestream while high and ideating with an audience.


eLOS is the most practical reduction of all the ideas i've had while on a journey with cannibis.
It helps bring control of your local and remotely stored files back into your hands.
It enables you to do what you want with that data. In a UI that you own, can tinker with, expand, or discard if you wish.
It lets you potentially turn that data into something more valuable, like a pdf to an audiobook, or a visual read-only timeline of a video.
It helps combat data and link rot by tracking all the places a file lives, on your computer and on networks.
It provides a doorway to showcasing what education can be, by those who know best, for those who need it most.
It takes the education responsibilities back into the hands of the student.
It gives the tools to most effectively consume it. Explore it. Expand it.
It has a modular nature, and can be extended at the UI or server level. Tooling is a limit of language and time.
